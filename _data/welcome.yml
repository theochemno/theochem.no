    - paragraph: CHOCO = Catalysts for Homogeneous conversion of CO2

    - paragraph: The CHOCO research team is combining  computational and experimental 
                 approaches to develop novel catalysts for chemical conversion of CO2 
                 into other molecules. The main focus is on homogeneous catalysis, but 
                 also biocatalytic approaches are explored. 

    - paragraph: The CHOCO team is working at the Dept. of Chemistry at UiT – The Artic 
                 University of Tromsø. The CHOCO project leader is Dr. Kathrin H. Hopmann 
                 from the Hylleraas Center for Quantum Molecular Sciences. Co-leader of the 
                 project team is Dr. Annette Bayer from the organic chemistry group at UiT.
